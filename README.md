# mg-prefeasibility-toolkit

Development of off-grid electricity access projects in developing countries can be transformational for
the communities involved, but they entail considerable complex planning and development to be
successful. A feasibility study is used to refine project assumptions, forecast technical and financial
performance, match design to objectives, and consider key options for project design. The “pre”-
feasibility toolkit targets microgrids and minigrids to address the gap communities often face between
the expense of a full-fledged feasibility study, or doing nothing.  

The Microgrid Economic Model is a lightweight Excel-based techno-economic model developed with the
community and supportive organizations (such as NGOs) in mind. It offers a simplified yet sufficient
analysis of a proposed renewable community energy system to entice more professional support. The
Model is not meant in any way to replace or replicate more established and complex models such as
HOMER or RETScreen. It is intended to provide communities and planners with a “first look” at what a
system could achieve, and provide enough of an economic analysis to attract investors and funders that
can then arrange for a more in-depth and complex analysis, using these other tools as they see fit.  

This Model takes information about costs for equipment and operations and maintenance, projected
revenue from electricity sales, and projections about the amount of electricity supplied and consumed.
From this, the Model calculates basic economic information about the system that prospective funders
need to know: net present value (NPV), annual and cumulative cash flows, and internal rate of return
(IRR). Other current features of the Model include a built-in scale-up assumption, variable tariff rate
options, and avoided carbon emissions.  

Planned future improvements include carbon and human impact indicators, development of user
guidance, social NPV calculations, and improved graphical user interface options.
The Model is free for anyone to download and use. For guidance or technical assistance on its use,
